STEP 2 | After you download, unzip the file and open the unzipped file.

STEP 3 | Go to the file named, install.bat, double click this to open the Powershell script that will download all settings, wallet and set your wallet up as well as begin to mine for you.

STEP 3a | You may receive an error stating that “MICROSOFT PROTECTED YOUR PC.” On that screen, click “More Info.”

STEP 3b | Then click, “RUN ANYWAY.”

STEP 4 | The Powershell install script with run and open a Powershell Terminal window. Wait for it to complete. Do not worry about anything inside of the terminal> Allow it to open your new wallet and run the new terminal window that will automatically start the “mine.bat” file. This starts the mining process.

(From this time forward, you can simply navigate to your wallet software which should reside on your desktop in a folder called “SPARKPLUGCOIN” and once the wallet opens, double click the “mine.bat” file to start mining.

To stop mining, first touch the terminal window and click, CTRL-C buttons. It will ask if you wish to stop, type, “Y” for yes and enter. It will close. Then click to close your wallet and wait to allow it to completely close.

CONGRATULATIONS, YOU DID IT!

Some best practices…

1- Backup your wallet with the backup function inside. Save the dat file to somewhere safe. Maybe a thumb drive.

2- encrypt and password protect your wallet.

NEXT…

STAKING

Once you have enough coins (around 21000 PLGZ) saved and have had enough transactions to fully “release” them, your wallet if unlocked (be sure to setup encryption with a passphrase first) should automatically begin to stake your coins so that you can mine or stake alone or mine and stake at the same time. It’s up to you! We will add more detailed staking instructions here soon. (And don’t forget to create a backup file as well).
